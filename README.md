# Final-Turn-in
First hit the run button so the gui figure pops up.  Then place inputs
that are integers in the x and y value boxes in the top left conner.  Your 
inputs need to be seperated by a coma and have the same number of x inputs as y.
An example would be x-inputs=4,5,6 and y-inputs=1,2,3.  Then hit the run button on 
the gui.  From there you can change the color and style of the graph by selecting 
one of the buttons.  Make sure to hit run again to register the changes.  You may
also add x and y limits on the side of the graph.  To clear all edit boxes press the 
resest button under the run button on the gui.  If any inouts return error double 
check then and make sure they are valid.
